## 🔬 Pharmacology Articles
###  Instrumental Approaches in Neuropharmacological Screening: A Review of Insights from Electroconvulsiometer and Actophotometer Studies
- The Electroconvulsiometer and Actophotometer are essential tools in neuropharmacology for evaluating CNS-active drugs. The Electroconvulsiometer models maximal electroshock seizures to assess anticonvulsant properties, while the Actophotometer measures locomotor activity to determine CNS stimulant or depressant effects. Together, they enable objective preclinical screening of neurological drug actions.

### Sitophilus oryzae: A comprehensive review of its biology, infestation dynamics and management strategies**
The rice weevil (*Sitophilus oryzae*) is a major global stored-grain pest causing significant post-harvest losses and reduced grain quality. While chemical pesticides provide control, concerns about resistance and environmental impact highlight the need for safer alternatives. This review summarizes its biology and feeding behavior while emphasizing sustainable IPM approaches, including botanicals, biocontrol, physical methods, and emerging molecular tools.

###  DOSTARLIMAB – A  MIRACLE  DRUG  RISING  HOPE AGAINST ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND  MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIELD OF ONCOLOGY.
Dostarlimab is a PD-1 monoclonal antibody that has shown remarkable clinical impact, offering high remission rates in dMMR/MSI-H endometrial and rectal cancers. Its targeted mechanism enhances T-cell–mediated immunity with fewer severe adverse effects compared to existing immunotherapies. This review highlights its mechanism, clinical trial breakthroughs, and growing significance as a safer, highly promising oncology treatment.

## 🧬 Innovative poster
### FROM GENES TO NUTRITION: MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES IN THE CARE OF SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
-  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, with disease severity influenced by SMN2 copy number. It leads to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and respiratory issues, ranging from severe infantile to milder later-onset forms. Recent molecular therapies—including antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and splicing modifiers—have transformed SMA into a treatable condition. Supportive care, especially nutritional management, remains vital to address swallowing difficulties, altered metabolism, and feeding challenges, improving health outcomes and quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for optimal patient care.

  ## 🧬 Nutraceutical article
### FROM GENES TO NUTRITION: MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES IN THE CARE OF SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
-  This work explores a novel Spinraza formulation using Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) to improve treatment outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). By enhancing cellular uptake, bioavailability, and targeted delivery while reducing toxicity and injection burden, GQD-based Spinraza aims to overcome the major limitations of conventional therapy. The approach highlights nanotechnology’s potential to create safer, more efficient, and patient-friendly SMA treatments.
