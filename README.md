## 🎯 Featured Projects

### 🏆 [Hybrid Mass Balance Model for Forced Degradation Studies](./NEST-Mass-Balance-Project.md)
**Novartis NEST 2.0 Innovation Challenge | Solo Researcher**

**The Problem:** Mass balance calculations in pharmaceutical stability studies frequently fall outside regulatory acceptance criteria (95-105%), delaying drug approvals and costing companies millions in submission delays.

**My Solution:** Developed a hybrid analytical-mathematical model integrating response factor correction, internal standard normalization, and peak purity adjustment.

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ **40% improvement** in mass balance accuracy
- ✅ Target consistency: **98-102%** (vs. current 92-105% variance)
- ✅ **Reproducible methodology** for regulatory submissions
- ✅ **Applicable industry-wide** across all pharmaceutical stability workflows

**Skills Demonstrated:** Analytical method validation, statistical modeling, regulatory science, independent research execution

**Status:** Round 1 submission complete | Advancing to mentorship phase

### 💼 [Tablet Manufacturing Process Optimization](./Process-Optimization-Case-Study.md)
**Process Consulting Project | 3 Weeks**

**The Business Challenge:** Standard tablet manufacturing line experiencing 26-hour cycle times, 6% rejection rates, and manual documentation creating compliance risks.

**My Approach:** Applied management consulting frameworks (Ishikawa diagrams, 5-Why analysis) to identify three critical bottlenecks: excessive drying time, compression weight variation, and documentation delays.

**Business Impact:**
- ⚡ **12% reduction in cycle time** (26h → 22.9h)
- 💰 **₹5 lakh annual cost savings** (reduced rework + increased capacity)
- 📈 **4-point improvement in first-pass yield** (94% → 98%)
- 💵 **<2-month ROI** on recommended equipment investment

**Deliverables:** Executive summary deck, ROI financial model, implementation roadmap with risk mitigation

**Why This Matters:** Demonstrates ability to apply structured business problem-solving to pharmaceutical operations—exactly what consulting firms deliver to manufacturing clients.

## 📄 Scientific Writing & Research

### [Instrumental Approaches in Neuropharmacological Screening](./Neuropharm-Screening-Review.pdf)

**Business Context:** Preclinical drug screening costs pharmaceutical companies $800M-$2.6B per approved drug. Accurate early-stage testing reduces expensive late-stage failures.

**My Contribution:** Comprehensive review of instrumental methods (Electroconvulsiometer, Actophotometer) for efficient CNS drug evaluation, providing standardized protocols for regulatory-ready screening.

**Commercial Impact:** Enables faster, more objective preclinical assessment, reducing R&D waste and improving reproducibility across labs—critical for regulatory submissions.

**Key Insight:** Standardized instrumental methods improve cross-lab comparisons and reduce variability in drug candidate selection.
