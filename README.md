# 📚 Kiruthika Ganesan – Academic Articles Repository

Welcome to my academic article collection.  
This repository includes writing, summaries, concept explanations, and subject-based articles created during my Bachelor of Pharmacy program.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my academic understanding, literature interpretation, and ability to communicate scientific concepts clearly.

---An enthusiastic pharmacy graduate with experience in academic writing, literature review, and conceptual interpretation across pharmacology, pharmaceutics, and analytical sciences. I aim to present scientific ideas in a structured and accessible manner.** you can use in your README or article:

### **I am deeply interested in nutraceutical science and biotechnology-driven healthcare innovations. My focus lies in understanding how bioactive compounds, functional foods, and emerging biotechnological approaches can support disease prevention and therapeutic development.**

## 🔬 **Pharmacology Articles**
### **1. Instrumental Approaches in Neuropharmacological Screening: A
Review of Insights from Electroconvulsiometer and Actophotometer
Studies**
- **Description:**The Electroconvulsiometer and Actophotometer are essential tools in neuropharmacology for evaluating CNS-active drugs. The Electroconvulsiometer models maximal electroshock seizures to assess anticonvulsant properties, while the Actophotometer measures locomotor activity to determine CNS stimulant or depressant effects. Together, they enable objective preclinical screening of neurological drug actions.

### **2. Sitophilus oryzae: A comprehensive review of its biology, infestation dynamics and management strategies**
- **Description:** Here is a **clean, concise academic summary (2–3 lines)** for your article:

**The rice weevil (*Sitophilus oryzae*) is a major global stored-grain pest causing significant post-harvest losses and reduced grain quality. While chemical pesticides provide control, concerns about resistance and environmental impact highlight the need for safer alternatives. This review summarizes its biology and feeding behavior while emphasizing sustainable IPM approaches, including botanicals, biocontrol, physical methods, and emerging molecular tools.**

## 🧪 **Poster presentation**
### **1. DOSTARLIMAB – A  MIRACLE  DRUG  RISING  HOPE AGAINST ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND  MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIELD OF ONCOLOGY.
**
- **Description:Dostarlimab is a PD-1 monoclonal antibody that has shown remarkable clinical impact, offering high remission rates in dMMR/MSI-H endometrial and rectal cancers. Its targeted mechanism enhances T-cell–mediated immunity with fewer severe adverse effects compared to existing immunotherapies. This review highlights its mechanism, clinical trial breakthroughs, and growing significance as a safer, highly promising oncology treatment.**

## 🧬 **Innovative poster**
### **1. SPINRAZA 2.0 ENHANCED EFFICACY WITH GRAPHENE QUANTUM DOTS**
- **Description:** This work explores a novel Spinraza formulation using Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) to improve treatment outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). By enhancing cellular uptake, bioavailability, and targeted delivery while reducing toxicity and injection burden, GQD-based Spinraza aims to overcome the major limitations of conventional therapy. The approach highlights nanotechnology’s potential to create safer, more efficient, and patient-friendly SMA treatments.
